## Technical Overview

### üèó **System Architecture**

Hilo's architecture is built for high performance and scalability, using a microservices approach. The system is divided into several key components:

- **Frontend**: Built with Next.js and React, providing a fast, responsive, and interactive user experience. Server-side rendering (SSR) ensures fast initial load times and better SEO.
- **Backend**: Powered by Node.js and Express.js, the backend handles API requests, user authentication, and business logic. The backend services are stateless and horizontally scalable.
- **Database**: MongoDB is used as the primary database, chosen for its flexibility and scalability in handling large volumes of unstructured data. Mongoose is used for schema modeling and data validation.
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket and Socket.IO are used for real-time chat features, ensuring low latency and seamless communication between users.
- **Media Storage**: Media files (images and videos) are stored in cloud-based storage solutions (e.g., AWS S3) to ensure scalability and availability, with CDN integration for fast content delivery.

### üîÑ **Microservices**

Hilo is designed with microservices in mind, where each service is responsible for a specific domain:

- **User Service**: Manages user profiles, authentication, and authorization.
- **Post Service**: Handles the creation, retrieval, and management of posts, including text, images, and videos.
- **Chat Service**: Manages real-time messaging, group chats, and conversation history.
- **Recommendation Service**: Powers the recommendation engine, using machine learning algorithms to personalize content for each user.
- **Notification Service**: Manages notifications for user interactions such as likes, comments, and new followers.

### üõ† **Scalability and Performance**

- **Load Balancing**: NGINX is used as a reverse proxy and load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend instances, ensuring optimal resource utilization.
- **Caching**: Redis is employed for caching frequently accessed data, reducing database load and improving response times.
- **Queueing**: RabbitMQ is used for asynchronous processing of tasks like sending notifications and processing media uploads, allowing the system to handle high traffic efficiently.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Prometheus and Grafana are used for monitoring system performance, while ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) is employed for centralized logging and troubleshooting.

### üóÑ **Database Design**

Hilo‚Äôs database schema is optimized for social media operations:

- **User Collection**: Stores user data, including profile information, hashed passwords, and user settings.
- **Post Collection**: Manages posts, with fields for content, media URLs, timestamps, and references to user and comment collections.
- **Comment Collection**: Stores comments on posts, with references to the post and user collections.
- **Conversation and Message Collections**: Designed to handle real-time messaging, with support for group chats and message history.
- **Notification Collection**: Logs user interactions, such as likes, comments, and follows, to power the notification service.

### üìà **Recommendation Engine**

The recommendation engine is a core feature of Hilo, leveraging collaborative filtering and content-based filtering algorithms:

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Analyzes user behavior and interactions to recommend content based on similar users' preferences.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Suggests posts similar to those a user has interacted with before, using text and media analysis.
- **Data Pipeline**: A data pipeline processes user interactions in real time, feeding into the recommendation algorithms to keep suggestions up-to-date.

## Conclusion

Hilo is engineered for performance, scalability, and user engagement. By adopting modern technologies and architectural patterns, Hilo offers a seamless social media experience while being robust enough to handle the demands of a growing user base.
