      <h3 id="-system-architecture-">
        üèó <strong>System Architecture</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Hilo&#39;s architecture is built for high performance and scalability,
        using a microservices approach. The system is divided into several key
        components:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Frontend</strong>: Built with Next.js and React, providing a
          fast, responsive, and interactive user experience. Server-side
          rendering (SSR) ensures fast initial load times and better SEO.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Backend</strong>: Powered by Node.js and Express.js, the
          backend handles API requests, user authentication, and business logic.
          The backend services are stateless and horizontally scalable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Database</strong>: MongoDB is used as the primary database,
          chosen for its flexibility and scalability in handling large volumes
          of unstructured data. Mongoose is used for schema modeling and data
          validation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Real-time Communication</strong>: WebSocket and Socket.IO are
          used for real-time chat features, ensuring low latency and seamless
          communication between users.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Media Storage</strong>: Media files (images and videos) are
          stored in cloud-based storage solutions (e.g., AWS S3) to ensure
          scalability and availability, with CDN integration for fast content
          delivery.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="-microservices-">üîÑ <strong>Microservices</strong></h3>
      <p>
        Hilo is designed with microservices in mind, where each service is
        responsible for a specific domain:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>User Service</strong>: Manages user profiles, authentication,
          and authorization.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Post Service</strong>: Handles the creation, retrieval, and
          management of posts, including text, images, and videos.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chat Service</strong>: Manages real-time messaging, group
          chats, and conversation history.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Recommendation Service</strong>: Powers the recommendation
          engine, using machine learning algorithms to personalize content for
          each user.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Notification Service</strong>: Manages notifications for user
          interactions such as likes, comments, and new followers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="-scalability-and-performance-">
        üõ† <strong>Scalability and Performance</strong>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Load Balancing</strong>: NGINX is used as a reverse proxy and
          load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend
          instances, ensuring optimal resource utilization.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Caching</strong>: Redis is employed for caching frequently
          accessed data, reducing database load and improving response times.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Queueing</strong>: RabbitMQ is used for asynchronous
          processing of tasks like sending notifications and processing media
          uploads, allowing the system to handle high traffic efficiently.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Monitoring and Logging</strong>: Prometheus and Grafana are
          used for monitoring system performance, while ELK Stack
          (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) is employed for centralized logging
          and troubleshooting.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="-database-design-">üóÑ <strong>Database Design</strong></h3>

          content, media URLs, timestamps, and references to user and comment
          collections.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Comment Collection</strong>: Stores comments on posts, with
          references to the post and user collections.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Conversation and Message Collections</strong>: Designed to
          handle real-time messaging, with support for group chats and message
          history.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Notification Collection</strong>: Logs user interactions, such
          as likes, comments, and follows, to power the notification service.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="-recommendation-engine-">
        üìà <strong>Recommendation Engine</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>
        The recommendation engine is a core feature of Hilo, leveraging
        collaborative filtering and content-based filtering algorithms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Collaborative Filtering</strong>: Analyzes user behavior and
          interactions to recommend content based on similar users&#39;
          preferences.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Content-Based Filtering</strong>: Suggests posts similar to
          those a user has interacted with before, using text and media
          analysis.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Pipeline</strong>: A data pipeline processes user
          interactions in real time, feeding into the recommendation algorithms
          to keep suggestions up-to-date.
        </li>
      </ul>
